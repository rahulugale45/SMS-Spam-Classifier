SMS Spam Classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Overview:
This project is an SMS Spam Classifier built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The classifier categorizes SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). It leverages advanced text preprocessing techniques and machine learning for accurate predictions, ensuring a robust solution for filtering spam messages.

Key Features:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning text data, removing stopwords, and applying stemming and lemmatization.
Feature Extraction: Using vectorization techniques to convert text data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models.
Machine Learning Model: Implemented using the Naive Bayes classifier for its efficiency in text-based tasks.
Performance Metrics: Achieved a training accuracy of 96% and a test accuracy of 97%.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:
Removal of punctuation and stopwords.
Applied stemming and lemmatization to normalize text data.
Vectorization: Converted textual data into numerical features using a vectorization technique.
Model Training and Testing:
Split the data into training and testing datasets.
Trained a Naive Bayes classifier on the processed data.
Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
Prediction and Evaluation:
Achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets, indicating excellent generalization.

Conclusion:
The SMS Spam Classifier is a reliable tool for distinguishing between spam and ham messages with a high degree of accuracy. By employing efficient text preprocessing and the Naive Bayes algorithm, the model demonstrates strong performance, making it suitable for real-world applications such as automated spam detection in messaging systems.

Future Enhancements:
Experiment with other machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to further improve accuracy.
Incorporate additional features such as message metadata for enhanced prediction performance.
Deploy the model into a live application or API for real-time spam filtering.
